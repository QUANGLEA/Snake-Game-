# Snake-Game

This project is written with Python 3.9.6

## Libraries imported:
1. math
2. random
3. pygame
4. tkinter

## Summary: 
This is a recreation of the popular Snake Game using Python 

## Description: 
This game is created with Object-Oriented principles. Similar to the original Snake Game, the objective is to get the highest score as possible by eating as much snack as possible. One difference is that in my version of Snake, it is possible for the Snake to go off-screen which would only relocate the Snake to the opposite side of the screen. The only way you lose is if the Snake bites itself.

## Installation:
1. Download the python file 
2. Make sure you have the latest Python version on your computer 
3. Make sure you have the libraries installed onto your computer (you can do this by ~pip install name_of_library)
5. Run the code 
6. There should be a Pygame window pop-up that shows a snake game 
7. Play and enjoy the game
