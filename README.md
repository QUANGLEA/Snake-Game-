## Description: 
This game is created with Object-Oriented principles. Similar to the original Snake Game, the objective is to get the highest score as possible by eating as much snack as possible. One difference is that in my version of Snake, it is possible for the Snake to go off-screen which would only relocate the Snake to the opposite side of the screen. The only way you lose is if the Snake bites itself.

## Installation:
1. Download the python file 
2. Run `python --version` to check the version of your Python
3. Download the latest python version at https://www.python.org/downloads/
4. Check whether you have `pip` installed on your machine by running `pip help`
5. If an error pops up, then you must install pip by following these tutorials https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows (for Windows) and https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-mac (for Mac) 
6. Open Snake.py in an IDE 
7. Install tkinter with `pip install tk` at the same directory 
8. Run Snake.py with an IDE
9. There should be a Pygame window pop-up that shows a snake game 
10. Play and enjoy the game
